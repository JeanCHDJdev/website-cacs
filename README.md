# website-cacs

---------------

This project designs a complete website for the aerospace society of CentraleSup√©lec, available in its full deployed glory right here : https://cacs.cs-campus.fr/.
In its current state, the project lacks large files such as video and photo content, now only available on the website and on its virtual machine hosting it.
The goal was to learn web development and therefore some code is slightly outdated or could have been written better; but it was a great learning experience.

Here are some page examples !

### Current Project Status

-------------

The website is not meant to be re-used anytime soon as it will be replaced by a WordPress equivalent so that new users can easily update the website, per choice of the new members of the association. This github page is both meant as legacy code, showcasing the project, and storing it. You can find the new website at the same address ! (as of 2025).
